# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I'm Nancy Sharma! üëã  
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Toronto-based Software Developer with strong experience in frontend technologies and production support management. With nearly 5 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable, user-centric applications using Vue.js, React, JavaScript, and TypeScript.  

I'm passionate about creating responsive, accessible web platforms, and continuously learning modern development best practices.  
I also have hands-on experience leading incident response, root cause analysis (RCA), and contributing to platform reliability for major financial clients.  

Currently, I am expanding my backend and cloud skills, diving deeper into Docker, CI/CD practices, and ITIL 4 foundations for IT service management. üöÄ  

Feel free to explore my projects ‚Äî I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, or exciting opportunities!
